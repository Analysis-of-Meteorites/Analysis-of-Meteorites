# Analysis of  Meteorites: Where they fell and when they fell!
![Analysis-of-Meteorites](https://github.com/theranjitraut/Analysis-of-Meteorites/blob/main/gfx/analysis-of-meteorites.png)

## Introduction
Meteorites are fragments of space debris that survive their passage through the Earth's atmosphere and impact the surface. They offer invaluable information about the early solar system and the processes that led to the formation of planets. This project aims to analyze the patterns and characteristics of meteorite falls, utilizing a large dataset containing information about 45,000 meteorite fall events. The study seeks to uncover trends related to the frequency, geographical distribution, and mass of meteorites over time.

## Description of the Data
The dataset contains information about meteorite falls, with 45,000 rows and multiple columns. Each row represents a specific meteorite fall event and includes details such as the name of the meteorite, a unique identifier, its classification, mass in grams, fall status (whether it fell or was found), the year it fell, and its geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude). This comprehensive dataset enables extensive analysis of meteorite falls across different periods and locations, providing insights into patterns and trends in meteorite impacts on Earth.

6. [ipykernel](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html)

## Background
Meteorite studies have significantly contributed to our understanding of the cosmos. Historical accounts of meteorite falls date back centuries, but systematic scientific investigations began in the 19th century. Meteorites are classified based on their composition and structure, with common types including stony, iron, and stony-iron meteorites. These classifications help scientists trace their origins and the conditions of their parent bodies. The dataset used in this project consolidates historical and modern records of meteorite falls, providing a robust foundation for analysis.

## Methodology
The analysis involves several steps, beginning with data collection and preprocessing. The dataset was obtained from reliable sources, ensuring its accuracy and completeness. Data cleaning procedures were applied to handle missing values and outliers. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand the basic characteristics of the data. Various visualization techniques were employed to depict trends and patterns. Advanced statistical methods and machine learning algorithms were also utilized to perform deeper analysis and clustering of meteorite falls based on their attributes.

## Results
The analysis revealed several key findings. First, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of recorded meteorite falls over the centuries, likely due to improved detection and reporting methods. Geographical distribution maps showed that certain regions have higher concentrations of meteorite falls, which could be attributed to population density and observation efforts. Additionally, the mass distribution of meteorites follows a skewed pattern, with a few very large meteorites and many smaller ones. Temporal trends indicate varying fall frequencies over different periods, possibly influenced by astronomical and environmental factors.
